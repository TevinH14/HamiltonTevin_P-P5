 Main feature 1: display user info

In this part of the application users will be able to see their favorite Star wars characters information 

Part 1: get data sources to get character data set i used the API called SWAPI (Star wars API). With this APi i will be able to pull detailed information on charaters that were in the star flims 1-8

Part 2: created a interfaceController in the Storyboard and Watch Extension folder, after doing that i added a table view to display the characters name to allow the user to make a selection on what character they will like to see in a the detail InterfaceController screen. Also in part to have parse the the Api url to get the data in the need to display user information 

part 3: created another interface controller and this where i display the character data to the user. i completed this by passing a custom object into the context to be able to display the selected data when entering into the next view.
